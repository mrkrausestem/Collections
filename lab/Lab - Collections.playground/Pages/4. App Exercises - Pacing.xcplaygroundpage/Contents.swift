/*:
 ## App Exercise - Difficulty
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a math tutoring app.
 
 You decide that you could use a dictionary to store different difficulties for the exercises in your application.
 
 Create a dictionary `difficulty` of type [String: Double] and assign it a dictionary literal with "Easy", "Medium", and "Hard" keys corresponding to values of 6.0, 8.0, and 10.0. These numbers correspond to the number of questions they are required to solve in 5 minutes. Print the dictionary. (1 point)
 */


/*:
 Add a new key/value pair to the dictionary. The key should be "Master" and the value should be 14.0. Print the dictionary. (.25 points)
 */


/*:
 Imagine the user in question gets faster over time and decides to update his/her pacing on activities. Update the values of "Medium" and "Fast" to 10 and 12, respectively. Print the dictionary. (.25 points)
 */


/*:
 Imagine the user in question decides not to store "Master" as one his/her regular paces. Remove "Master" from the dictionary. Print the dictionary. (.5 points)
 */


/*:
 When a user chooses a difficulty, you want the app to print a statement stating that it will keep him/her on pace. Imagine a user chooses "Medium." Accessing the value from the dictionary, print a statement saying "Okay! I'll keep you at <INSERT VALUE HERE> difficulty." (.5 points)
